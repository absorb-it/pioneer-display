# pioneer remote display for DEH-X7800DAB
[[/images/pioneer.jpg|Pioneer Radio]]

This is a library to add a remote display to a DEH-X7800DAB radio. The data is internally transferred via SPI, so you can easily use this data and attach a display at another place. You just have to know how to interpret the datastream - and that's what this library is all about.

[Checkout the wiki](https://github.com/absorb-it/pioneer-display/wiki) for more information and how I managed to interpret the datastream - maybe this helps you to adapt the code for any other Car Hifi Systems.

And at the end you might add some buttons, use the [remote control hack as described there](http://www.jvde.net/node/7) and have your second controller for your radio:
